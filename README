Sean and Kevin Closest pairs

How our gridded approach works.
In out gridded approach we used a two dimensional array of vectors to store
pairs of points. We the two dimensional array is the grid and to decide how to populate
the grid is as follows.

First we calculate the max of the random x varibles and the max of the y variables.
Seconds we create an xIndex  and Yindex or where we are going to put the variable by
taking the value stored at the first element of the array and divide it by the (maxX
or maxY variable / the dimension of the grid). The dimension of the grid is the square root
of the number of points. We chose this value because of the pigenhole principle.

To calculate closestPair
the grided approach then checks to see if the xindex and yindex is empty. if not it checks for pairs inside
the grid cell. if there are no pairs then it checks the cell to the right, below and diagnal.

After it has checked those it checks special cases where the cell is on the border or the rightmost element.
